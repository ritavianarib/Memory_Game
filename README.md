# Memory Game - Vanilla JavaScript

The memory game is a basic matching game to put the player's
short-term memory to the test. While playing this game, a sequence of
images will emerge in a box-shaped region. To win the battle, the player
must locate two identical images and click on them.

How to play Memory Game?
Click on the cards or press the kevboard kevs to reconstruct the pairs of
images by turning them 2 by 2 and discover the image hidden underneath!
If the cards turned face up are the same (a pair), you win and get points
for it!
Otherwise, the cards are automatically turned face down and you will lose
your point!

Why Memory Game?
The Memory Game is a perfect project for beginners, to
understand how to apply JavaScript to make a dynamic and interactive
game from scratch.
To build this game we have to know how to use variables, functions, loops,
intervals, objects and configure event listeners and update elements using
JavaScript. As well as using interactive HTML elements and putting CSS
techniques into practice. That's why this game is extremely useful for us to
put into practice everything we've learned in this first module.
